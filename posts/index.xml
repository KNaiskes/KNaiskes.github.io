      <description>I was thinking of starting a blog for weeks but never really found the time to start developing it. And I am saying developing because like most developers I know, I wanted my blog to be made from scratch by me using a static site generator. You know the reason&amp;hellip; just for fun!
So, the static site generator I am using is Hugo with a very simple - minimalistic theme, I made in just a few hours (yes it took me so long for such a simple theme).</description>
