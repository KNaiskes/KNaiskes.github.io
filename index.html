        A couple of days ago, I had a project with a list of hundreds of books titles and decided, instead of sorting them during the runtime, it would be better to be sorted inside the source code.
My very first thought was to use Python or Bash as I have used both of these scripting languages in the past for such tasks and while I was waiting for Emacs to load (just a couple of seconds) and was thinking of how I should implement this simple script.

        I was thinking of starting a blog for weeks but never really found the time to start developing it. And I am saying developing because like most developers I know, I wanted my blog to be made from scratch by me using a static site generator. You know the reason&hellip; just for fun!
So, the static site generator I am using is Hugo with a very simple - minimalistic theme, I made in just a few hours (yes it took me so long for such a simple theme).
